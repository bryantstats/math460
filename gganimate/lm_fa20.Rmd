- The goal of linear model is to solve for $w_0$, $w_1$ and $w_2$
- To **train** a linear model is to find $w_0$, $w_1$ and $w_2$

# Approach 1: Explicitly solve for it!


- The function reaches the mimumum when the partial derivarives are all zeros. 

---
# Approach 1: Explicitly solve for it!


- The function reaches the mimumum when the partial derivarives are all zeros. 

- We need to solve for: 

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_0} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_2} = 0$$

# Approach 1: Explicitly solve for it!


- The function reaches the minimum when the partial derivatives are all zeros. 

- We need to solve for: 

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_0} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_2} = 0$$


- Or

$$8w_0+20w_1+4w_2+4 = 0$$
      $$20w_0+60w_1+16w_2+2 = 0$$
      $$4w_0+16w_1+28w_2-10 = 0$$




---
# Approach 1: Explicitly solve for it!

- Explicitly solve for $w_0, w_1, w_2$ 

$$w_0 = -\frac{61}{28} = -2.178$$
$$w_1 = \frac{17}{28}=0.607$$
$$w_2 = \frac{9}{28}=0.3214$$


---
# Approach 2: Gradient Descent

- Approximately find for $w_0, w_1, w_2$ that minimizes the total loss function $L(w)$.



---
# Approach 2: Gradient Descent


- **Step 1**: Initiate values for $w_0, w_1, w_2$
- **Step 2**: Update the values of $w_0, w_1, w_2$ by

$$w_0^{new} = w_0^{old} - \alpha\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_0}(w^{old})$$
      $$w_1^{new} = w_1^{old} - \alpha\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}(w^{old})$$
      $$w_2^{new} = w_2^{old} - \alpha\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_2}(w^{old})$$

# The learning rate


![](images/l1.png)

- The learning rate $\alpha$: $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1,$ 

- The learning rate controls the size of the step toward the gradient. 

- A large learning rate may result the divergent $w$.

- A small learning rate may result a slow convergence.  

---
# Why bother with approach 2?

- It's computationally cheaper (faster) to find the solution using the gradient descent in some cases.

---
# How about other loss functions?

- Absolute loss: $$L(\hat{y},y) = |\hat{y}-y|$$

# How to find $w_0, w_1, w_2$?

- **Step 1**: Define the loss function $l(\hat{y},y)$
- **Step 2**: Find $w$ that minimizes the total loss function


---
# Logistic Regression

- Define the loss function: We use the log-loss or cross-entropy loss function
$$
l(\hat{y},y) = -y \log(\hat{y})-(1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})
$$

- Total Loss:

$$\begin{aligned}
L(w_0, w_1, w_2) = & -\log\bigg(\frac{1}{1+e^{-w_0-w_1}} \bigg) \\
&-\log\bigg(1- \frac{1}{1+e^{-w_0-2w_1-w_2}} \bigg) \\
&-\log\bigg(1- \frac{1}{1+e^{-w_0-3w_1+w_2}} \bigg) \\
&-\log\bigg(\frac{1}{1+e^{-w_0-4w_1-3w_2}} \bigg) \end{aligned}$$

- We need to find $w_0, w_1, w_2$ that minimizes the total loss

# How to find the coefficients?

- **Approach 2**: Use approximation techniques to approximate the solutions.
- Gradient Descent works just fine!

---
# A general framework

- **Problem**:  Given the data of $x_1, x_2,..., x_d, y$, establish the *best* relation between $y$ and $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_d]$. 

- A solution framework:
    - Step 1: Assume the model function $\hat{y} = f(x, w)$, where $w$ is a parameter vector. 
    - Step 2: Define the loss function $l(y, \hat{y})$
    - Step 3: Find $w$ that minimizes the loss function using gradient descent

---
# Regularization 

- Minimizing the total loss function $L(w_0, w_1, w_2)$ would result the best performance on the **training** data. 

- But it could lead to **overfitting**, i.e. not performing well on the testing data. 

- How can we avoid overfitting? 

---
# Regularization 

- We void overfitting by minimizing a loss function adding a quantity

$$
L(w_0, w_1, w_2) + A,
$$

where $A$ usually measures the magnitude of the parameters. 

---
# LASSO 

- In LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), we minimize: 

$$
L(w_0, w_1, w_2) + \alpha \bigg( |w_1|+|w_2| \bigg),
$$

- Increasing $\alpha$ will make $w_1$, and $w_2$ small quickly or often shrink to 0. 
- A tiny $\alpha$ imposes no penalty on the coefficient size, and is equivalent to a normal linear regression model.
- LASSO can be used for variable selection: variables associated with zeros coefficient will be removed.  

---
# Ridge Regression 

- In Ridge Regression, we minimize: 

$$
L(w_0, w_1, w_2) + \alpha \bigg( w_1^2+w_2^2 \bigg),
$$

- Increasing $\alpha$ will make $w_1$, and $w_2$ small (much slower than LASSO). 

---
# LASSO vs. Ridge  

- Lasso regression shrinks coefficients all the way to zero, thus removing them from the model

- Ridge regression shrinks coefficients toward zero, but they rarely reach zero

---
# LASSO vs. Ridge  

- Lasso is equivalent to: 

$$\text{ Minimize : }  L(w_0, w_1, w_2)$$
$$\text{Subject to: } |w_1|+|w_2| \leq t$$

where $t$ is a decreasing function of $\alpha$. 

- Ridge Regression is equivalent to: 

$$\text{ Minimize : }  L(w_0, w_1, w_2)$$
$$\text{Subject to: } w_1^2+w_2^2 \leq t$$

where $t$ is a decreasing function of $\alpha$. 

---
# LASSO vs. Ridge

Notice that:
 
$$
\text{RSS} = L(w_0, w_1, w_2)
$$

---
# ElasticNet

- ElasticNet is a combination of LASSO and Ridge, minimizing

$$
L(w_0, w_1, w_2) + \alpha (1-l_1) \bigg( w_1^2+w_2^2 \bigg) + \alpha l_1 \bigg( |w_1|+|w_2| \bigg),
$$
  
  - If $l_1 = 1$: We have LASSO
  - If $l_1 = 0$: We have Ridge
