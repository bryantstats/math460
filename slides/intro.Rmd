# What is Data Mining?

- Data Mining can be defined as the process that starting from apparently unstructured data tries to extract knowledge and/or unknown interesting patterns.

- During this process **Machine Learning algorithms** are used.

# Data Mining vs. Machine Learning

- What are the differences?

- The short answer is:  **None.** 

- "They are concerned with the same question:  how do we learn from data?" - Wasserman.

# Machine learning Algorithms

- Machine Learning relates with the study, design and development of the algorithms that give computers the capability to **learn** without being **explicitly** programmed

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Explicit vs. Implicit Programming

# Explicit vs. Implicit Programming

- **Problem**:  Solve by a quadratic equation using computer. 
  - Input: A quadratic Equation
  - Output: Its solutions

$$
ax^2+bx+c = 0
$$
  

- **Explicit** approach: using the quadratic formula 

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

- **Implicit** approach:  
  - Collect data:  Find 1000 (or more!) quadratic equations with solutions.
  - Train models:  Train multiple models to "learn" the relationship between the 100 equations and their solutions
  - Validate model: Test the trained model to select the **best** model to use
  - Use the best model "predict" the solutions of a given equation

---
# Explicit vs. Implicit Programming

- ML approach needs data; explicit programming approach does not.

- Machine:  Without data, there is no learning!

- Human: Without experience, there is no learning!  

---
# Different types of Learning

- **Supervised learning**: We use supervised learning algorithms when we want to *predict* something from the data.  

- **Unsupervised learning**: We use unsupervised learning algorithms when we want to understand the structure of the data.

# Supervised vs. Unsupervised

- **Supervised learning** requires **labels**
- There are **training** data and **testing** data in supervised learning.

# Supervised vs. Unsupervised

- **Supervised learning** requires **labels**
- There are **training** data and **testing** data in supervised learning. 
- We can measure the **accuracy** of supervised learning algorithm.
