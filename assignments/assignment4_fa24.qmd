[Video Instruction]()

1. Create a SAS Library and into the library the following dataset

[Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://bryantstats.github.io/math460/data/breast_cancer.csv)

2. Create a data source from the above dataset for model building. Reject all the `text` variables.  Set `diagnosis` as the binary target. 

3. Split the data 70:30:0 for Training: Validation: Test. Train the following models.  

    - A random forest of 100 trees maximum
  
    - A random forest of 200 trees maximum
  
    - A random forest that have 150 trees maximum and consider 3 variables at each split for the trees.
  
    - A gradient boosting with 200 iterations and the learning rate (shrinkage) of 0.05
    
    - A bagging model of 5 regression models
    
    - A boosting model of 5 regression models

4. Out of the models in Question 3, what is the best model in term of misclassification? 

5. Make an effort to find a better model than the model in Question 4
