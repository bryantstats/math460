-------

Find a dataset to train following models to predict your interested binary target variable

- Logistic Regression using no model selection method

- Logistic Regression using the stepwise model selection method

- LASSO

- A neural network with two hidden layers. The number of neurons of the layers are:  $2 \times 4$

- A neural network with five hidden layers. The number of neurons of the layers are:  $2\times4\times3\times2\times1$

- A neural network of your own design

Compare the models to determine the best model among the above models.
