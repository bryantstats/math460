Follow this below video and this notebook to implement a tree based model (Gradient Boosting, Adaboost or Random Forest) for image recognition. **Make sure you have similar amount of images for each categories**.  Record a presentation of your final model and upload the link to Canvas. 

- Link to the video: [link](https://bryant.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cc0acb3e-295b-40d3-a813-af4b00168c19)

In your presentation you should

- Show your training data, testing data

- Present the performance (prediction) of your model.  

- Try different values of number of trees, learning rate, and dimension (dim) then comment on the changes (if any) in the model prediction with these different values.  

- What are your final values selection for the number of trees, learning rate, and dimension?

- Are you happy with the model? If not, how would you do if you have time to improve the model. 

- Discuss any issue you run into training the model.
