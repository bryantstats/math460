1. Form the confusion matrix when the cutoff value for positive outcome is c=.6.  Calculate the sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-Score when c = 0.6
2. Among the cutoff value of 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, what is the cut-off value that produce the greatest F1-Score?
3. Sketch the ROC curve.
4. Sketch and interpret a few points of the Cumulative Lift
5. Sketch the Cumulative % Response
