[Sample Problem](assignment3_fa23_sample2.pdf)

**Problem 1** 

Given the following training data.  You want to build a regression tree to predict $y$ from $x_1$ and $x_2$. 

|Points| $x_1$    | $x_2$ | $y$
|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|
|A| 3   | 0           |3.5|
|B| 2   | 5           |3.7|
|C| 2   | 3           |4.0|
|D| 0   | 0           |2.5|
|E| 0   | 1           |3.0|

a. Using the Residual Sum Squares (RSS) to decide the better split between

- Split 1: Region 1: $x_1 \leq 1$, Region 2: $x_1 > 1$ 

- Split 2: Region 1: $x_2 \leq 2$, Region 2: $x_2 > 2$ 

b. Suppose that your regression tree contain only one split which is the best split in the previous question. Calculate the $R^2$ of this regression tree on the training data. 

c. Use your regression tree to predict the $y$ for the below testing data.  Calculate the $R^2$ of the tree on the below testing data.

|Points| $x_1$    | $x_2$ | $y$|
|:----------------|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------|
|F| 3   | 1           |3.0|
|G| 1   | 5           |3.6|
|H| 2   | 1           |4.0|
|I| 0   | 2           |3.9|
